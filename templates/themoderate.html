                                <p>As it is known that,  <strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">algebra</i></strong> is the concept based on unknown values called variables. The important concept of algebra is equations. It follows various rules to perform arithmetic operations. The rules are used to make sense of sets of data that involves two or more variables. It is used to analyse many things around us. You will probably use the concept of algebra without realising it. Algebra is divided into different sub-branches such as: <br> elementary algebra <br> advanced algebra <br> abstract algebra <br> linear algebra <br> and commutative algebra.</p>

                                    <p>As it is known that,  algebra is the concept based on unknown values called variables. The important concept of algebra is equations. It follows various rules to perform arithmetic operations. The rules are used to make sense of sets of data that involves two or more variables. It is used to analyse many things around us. You will probably use the concept of algebra without realising it. Algebra is divided into different sub-branches such as elementary algebra, advanced algebra, abstract algebra, linear algebra, and commutative algebra.</p>
                                    
                                    
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Algebra 1 or Elementary Algebra</i></strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>Elementary Algebra covers the traditional topics studied in a modern elementary algebra course. Arithmetic includes numbers along with mathematical operations like +, -, x,  ÷. But in the field of algebra, the numbers are often represented by the symbols and are called variables such as x, a, n, y. It also allows the common formulation of the laws of arithmetic such as, a + b = b + a and it is the first step that shows the systematic exploration of all the properties of a system of real numbers.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The concepts coming under the elementary algebra includes variables, evaluating expressions and equations, properties of equalities and inequalities, solving the algebraic equations and linear equations having one or two variables, and so on.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Algebra 2 or Advanced Algebra</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>This is the intermediate level Algebra or you can say prerequisite of Algebra 1. This algebra has a high level of equations to solve as compared to pre-algebra. Advanced algebra will help you to go through the other parts of algebra such as:
                                <ul>

                                   <p> <strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Abstract Algebra</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>Abstract algebra is one of the divisions in algebra which discovers the truths relating to algebraic systems independent of specific nature of some operations. These operations in specific cases have certain properties. Thus we can conclude some consequences of such properties. Hence this branch of mathematics called abstract algebra.</p>
                                    
                                <p>Abstract algebra deals with algebraic structures like the fields, groups, modules, rings, lattices, vector spaces, etc.</p>
                                    
                                   <p> <strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">The concepts of the abstract algebra are below-</i></strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>1)Sets – Sets is defined as the collection of the objects that are determined by some specific property for a set. For Example- A set of all the 2 by 2 matrices, the set of two-dimensional vectors present in the plane and different form of finite groups.</p>
                                    <p>2)Binary Operations – When the concept of addition is conceptualized, it gives the binary operations. The concept of all the binary operations will be meaningless without a set.</p>
                                    <p>3)Identity Element – The numbers 0 and 1 are conceptualized to give the idea of an identity element for a specific operation. Here, 0 is called the identity element for the operation addition, whereas 1 is called the identity element for the operation multiplication.</p>
                                    <p>4)Inverse Elements – The idea of Inverse elements comes up with a negative number. For addition, we write “-a” as the inverse of “a” and for the purpose of multiplication the inverse form is written as  “a-1”.</p>
                                    <p>5)Associativity – When integers are added, there is a property known as associativity in which the grouping up of numbers added does not affect the sum. Consider for Example – (3 + 2) + 4 = 3 + (2 + 4)</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Linear Algebra</i></strong></p>
                                   <p> Linear algebra is a branch of algebra which applies to both applied as well as pure mathematics. It deals with the linear mappings between the vector spaces. It also deals with the study of planes and lines. It is the study of linear sets of equations with the transformation properties. It is almost used in all the areas of Mathematics. It concerns the linear equations for the linear functions with their representation in vector spaces and through the matrices. The important topics covered in linear algebra are as follows:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                   <li> Linear equations</li>
                                   <li>Vector Spaces</li>
                                   <li>Relations</li>
                                   <li>Matrices and matrix decomposition</li>
                                   <li>Relations and Computations</li>
                                    </ul> <br>
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Commutative algebra</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>Commutative algebra is one of the branches of algebra that studies the commutative rings and its ideals. The algebraic number theory, as well as the algebraic geometry, depends on the commutative algebra. It includes rings of algebraic integers, polynomial rings, and so on. There are many other areas of mathematics, that draw upon commutative algebra in different ways such as differential topology, invariant theory, order theory, and general topology. It has occupied a remarkable role in modern pure mathematics.</p>

                                    What is a <strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">matrix?</i></strong> Ever wondered what do the elements in a matrix mean? Why is it represented in a particular form? Why do we study a matrix? Does it really have any real-life application? I would say yes, matrices are the most important and are a basic part of maths which are used in higher studies and real-life problems.</p>
                                    <p>Matrices are one of the most powerful tools in mathematics. The evolution of the concept of matrices is the result of an attempt to obtain compact and simple methods of solving the system of linear equations. Let’s find what is a matrix and its applications.</p>
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Definition of a Matrix</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>Matrix is an ordered rectangular arrangement of numbers (real or complex) or functions</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Matrix is enclosed by [ ] or ( )</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>Suppose we wish to express the information that Ram has 20 pens. We may express it as [20] with the understanding that the number inside [ ] is the number of pens that Ram has. Now, if we have to express that Ram has 20 pens and 7  pencils. We may express it as [20 7] with the understanding that first number inside [ ] is the number of pens while the other one is the number of pencils.</p>
                                    <p>Let us now suppose that we wish to express the information of possession of pens and pencils by Ram and his two friends Rohan and Yash which is as follows: <br>
                                    Ram has 20 pens and 7 pencils<br>
                                    Rohan has 15 pens and 5 pencils. <br>
                                    Yash has 12 pens and 3 pencils.</p> <br>
                                    <p>Now, this could be arranged in tabular form as follows:</p>
                                    <pre>                                        
                                                            Pens              Pencils
                                    Ram                 20                    7
                                    Rohan             15                    5
                                    Yash                12                    3 <br>
    and this can be expressed as, [20 7
                                                                15 5
                                                                 12 3]
                                    </pre>
                                     <p>In the above arrangement, the entries in the first column represent the number of pens possessed by Ram, Rohan, and Yash, respectively and the entries in the second column represents the number of pencils possessed by Ram, Rohan, and Yash, respectively.</p>
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Order of a Matrix</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>A matrix having m rows and n columns is called a matrix of order m × n or simply m × n matrix (read as an m by n matrix). In general, an m × n matrix has the following rectangular array;</p>
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Application of Matrices</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>Most Scientific Fields have Applications of Matrices in some or the other form. Almost every branch of physics, including classical mechanics, optics, electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, and quantum electrodynamics, matrices are used to study physical phenomena, such as the motion of rigid bodies.</p>
                                    <p>In computer graphics, they are used to project a 3-dimensional image onto a 2-dimensional screen. In probability theory and statistics, stochastic matrices are used to describe sets of probabilities; for instance, they are used within the Page Rank algorithm that ranks the pages in a Google search.
                                    Matrix calculus generalizes classical analytical notions such as derivatives and exponentials to higher dimensions. The graphics software uses the concept of a matrix to process linear transformations to render images.</p>

                                    <strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Probability Definition</i></strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>Probability means possibility. It is a branch of mathematics that deals with the occurrence of a random event. The value is expressed between zero and one. Probability has been introduced in Maths to predict how likely events are to happen.
                                    The meaning of probability is basically the extent to which something is likely to happen. This is the basic probability theory which is also used in the probability distribution, where you will learn the possibility of outcomes for a random experiment. To find the probability of a single event to occur, first we should know the total number of possible outcomes.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event to occur. Many events cannot be predicted with total certainty. We can predict only the chance of an event to occur i.e. how likely they are to happen, using it. Probability can range in between 0 to 1, where 0 means the event to be an impossible one and 1 indicates a certain event. Probability for class 10 is an important topic for the students which explains all the basic concepts of this topic. The probability of all the events in a sample space sums up to 1.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>For example, when we toss a coin, either we get Head OR Tail, only two possible outcomes are possible (H, T). But if we toss two coins in the air, there could be three possibilities of events to occur, such as both the coins show heads or both shows tails or one shows heads and one tail, i.e.(H,H), (H,T),(T,T).</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Probabiltiy of an event</i></strong></p>
                                    
                                    <p>Assume an event E can occur in r ways out of a sum of n probable or possible equally likely ways. Then the probability of happening of the event or its success  is expressed as;
                                    
                                    P(E) = r/n</p>
                                    
                                    <p>The probability that the event will not occur or known as its failure is expressed as:</p>
                                <pre>    
                                P(E’) = n-r/n = 1-r/n
                                E’ represents that the event will not occur.
                                Therefore, now we can say;
                                P(E) + P(E’) = 1
                                </pre>
                                        <p>This means that the total of all the probabilities in any random test or experiment is equal to 1.</p>

                                   <pre> There are three major types of probabilities:
                                    
                                    Theoretical Probability
                                    Experimental Probability
                                    Axiomatic Probability
                                    Theoretical Probability</pre>
                                    <p>It is based on the possible chances of something to happen. The theoretical probability is mainly based on the reasoning behind probability. For example, if a coin is tossed, the theoretical probability of getting head will be ½.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Experimental Probability</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>It is based on the basis of the observations of an experiment. The experimental probability can be calculated based on the number of possible outcomes by the total number of trials. For example, if a coin is tossed 10 times and heads is recorded 6 times then, the experimental probability for heads is 6/10 or, 3/5.</p>
                                    
                                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Axiomatic Probability</i></strong></p>
                                    <p>In axiomatic probability, a set of rules or axioms are set which applies to all types. These axioms are set by Kolmogorov and are known as Kolmogorov’s three axioms. With the axiomatic approach to probability, the chances of occurrence or non-occurrence of the events can be quantified. The axiomatic probability lesson covers this concept in detail with Kolmogorov’s three rules (axioms) along with various examples.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>Conditional Probability is the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring based on the occurrence of a previous event or outcome.</p>

                                <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Statistics</i></strong></p>


                                <p>Statistics is the study of the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. In other words, it is a mathematical discipline to collect, summarize data.
                    
                    According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, statistics is defined as “classified facts representing the conditions of a people in a state – especially the facts that can be stated in numbers or any other tabular or classified arrangement”.</p>
                    
                    <p>According to statistician Sir Arthur Lyon Bowley, statistics is defined as “Numerical statements of facts in any department of inquiry placed in relation to each other”.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Mathematical Statistics</i></strong></p>
                    <p>Mathematical statistics is the application of Mathematics to Statistics, which was originally conceived as the science of the state — the collection and analysis of facts about a country: its economy, and, military, population, and so forth.
                    
                    Mathematical techniques used for this include mathematical analysis, linear algebra, stochastic analysis, differential equation and measure-theoretic probability theory.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Scope</i></strong></p>
                    <p>Statistics is used in many sectors such as psychology, geology, sociology, weather forecasting, probability and much more. The goal of statistics is to gain understanding from data it focuses on applications and hence, it is distinctively considered as a Mathematical science.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Methods</i></strong></p>
                    <p>The methods involve collecting, summarizing, analyzing, and interpreting variable numerical data. Here are some of the methods provided below. <br>
                    1.Data collection <br>
                    2.Data summarization <br>
                    3.Statistical analysis</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Data</i></strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Data is a collection of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations etc. <br>
                    
                    Types of Data: <br>
                    
                    Qualitative data- it is descriptive data. <br>
                    Example- She can run fast, He is thin. <br>
                    Quantitative data- it is numerical information. <br>
                    Example- An Octopus is an Eight legged creature. <br>
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    1.Discrete data- has a particular fixed value. It can be counted <br>
                    2.Continuous data- is not fixed but has a range of data. It can be measured. </p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Types of Statistics</i></strong></p>
                    <p>Basically, there are two types of statistics. <br>
                    1.Descriptive Statistics <br>
                    2.Inferential Statistics <br>
                    In case of descriptive statistics, the data or collection of data is described in a summary. But in the case of inferential stats, it is used to explain the descriptive one. Both these types have been used in large scale.</p>
                    
                    <p>There is one more type of statistics, where descriptive is transitioned into inferential stats.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Applications</i></strong></p>

                    2.Suppose you need to find how many members are employed in a city. But since the city is populated with 15 lacs people, hence we will take a survey here for 1000 people (sample). Based on that we will create the data, which is the statistic.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Variance and Standard Deviation</i></strong></p>
                    
                    <p>A measure of dispersion is important for statistical analysis. Such concepts find extensive applications in disciplines like finance, business, accounting etc. We rely a lot on such measures from analyzing a stock to studying a student’s performance. We now know about range and mean as measures of dispersion. Now let us study the most widely used tools in the dispersion toolbox- Variance and Standard Deviation.</p>
                    <p>Need for Variance and Standard Deviation</p>
                    <p>We have studied mean deviation as a good measure of dispersion. But a major problem is that mean deviation ignores the signs of deviation, otherwise they would add up to zero. To overcome this limitation variance and standard deviation came into the picture. Unlike mean deviation, standard deviation and variance do not operate on this sort of assumption. Rather they make use of the squares of deviations.</p>
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Standard Deviation</i></strong></p>
                    <p>Standard deviation is the most important tool for dispersion measurement in a distribution. Technically, the standard deviation is the square root of the arithmetic mean of the squares of deviations of observations from their mean value. It is generally denoted by sigma i.e. σ.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>Note that unlike mean deviation that can be measured by mean, median and mode, S.D. can be measured by mean only. As there are three classes of distributions, we calculate the standard deviation for all three types in a different way. Let us study them individually.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Individual Series</i></strong></p>
                    <p>Initially, we calculate the value of the arithmetic mean. Further, we calculate the value of deviation for each observation about mean using the formula: D= X – Mean. In the next step, we divide the summation of squares of these deviations by the number of observations. Finally, the square root of this value is the standard deviation. The formula is as follows: <br>
                    Standard Deviation (σ)= √[∑D²/N] <br>
                    
                    Here, D= Deviation of an item relative to mean, <br>
                    
                    N= The number of observations</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Discrete Series</i></strong></p>
                    <p>In discrete series, each observation is associated with a frequency. Hence, the formula for calculation of standard deviation changes accordingly to include frequency. The formula is as follows: <br>
                    
                    Standard deviation(σ)= √(∑fD²)/N) <br>
                    
                    Here, D= Deviation of an item relative to the mean calculated as, D= X – Mean, <br>
                    
                    f= Frequencies corresponding to the observations, <br>
                    
                    N= The Summation of frequency</p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Frequency Distribution Series</i></strong></p>
                    <p>The approach towards the calculation of standard deviation for frequency distribution is pretty much the same as for discrete series. The only difference occurs when using the values of observations. The mid values of the classes are derived dividing the sum of upper and lower value of class and this value is used for calculations. The formula is: <br>
                    
                    Standard deviation(σ)= √(∑fD²)/N) <br>
                    
                    Here, D= Deviation of an item relative to the mean calculated as, D= Xi – Mean <br>
                    
                    f= Frequencies corresponding to the observations <br>
                    
                    N= The summation of frequency </p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Another Approach for Standard Deviation</i></strong></p>
                    <p>There is another formula for calculation of standard deviation, effectively derived from the traditional formula. The formula is: <br>
                    
                    Standard Deviation= √[N∑fx² – ( ∑fx)²] ÷ N <br>
                    
                    f = Frequency corresponding to an observation <br>
                    
                    x= The value of observation (for discrete distribution) or the mid-point of the class (for frequency distribution) </p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Variance</i></strong></p>
                    <p>Although standard deviation is the most important tool to measure dispersion, it is essential to know that it is derived from the variance. Variance uses the square of deviations and is better than mean deviation. However, since variance is based on the squares, its unit is the square of the unit of items and mean in the series.</p>
                    
                    <p>With this in mind, statisticians use the square root of the variance, popularly known as standard deviation. Effectively, the square root of the variance is the standard deviation. With the knowledge of calculating standard deviation, we can easily calculate variance as the square of standard deviation. <br>
                    
                    Variance = ( Standard deviation)² = σ×σ </p>
                    
                    <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Short Method to Calculate Variance and Standard Deviation</i></strong></p>
                    <p>We are familiar with a shortcut method for calculation of mean deviation based on the concept of step deviation. Similarly, such a method can also be used to calculate variance and effectively standard deviation. We use this approach when the values of observations (discrete series) or the values of mid-points of intervals (frequency distribution) are too large.</p>
                    
                    <p>This method simplifies the calculation of mean and variance in such cases. Here, we assume a value in the series as the mean and divide the deviations by width h of the intervals ( known as step deviations D’). Lastly, we use the step deviations to calculate standard deviation as follows: <br>
                    
                    Standard deviation(σ)= √[N×(∑fD’²) – (∑fD’/N)²]  × (h/N) <br>
                    
                    Here, D’= Step-deviation of observations relative to an assumed value, calculated as D’= (X-A)/h <br>

                    <p>The lower limit of the first class interval i.e. 0-5 is ‘0’. <br>
                    The class limits of the third class, i.e. 10-15 are 10 (lower limit) and 15 (upper limit). <br>
                    The classmark is defined as the average of the upper and lower limits of a class. For 5-10, the classmark is (5+10)/2 = 7.5 <br>
                    The class size is the difference between the lower and upper class-limits. Here, we have a uniform class size, which is equal to 5 (5 – 0, 10 – 5, 15 – 10, 20 – 15 are all equal to 5).</p>

                                <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Trigonometry</i></strong> is one of the important branches in the history of mathematics and this concept is given by a Greek mathematician Hipparchus. Here, we study the relationship between the sides and angles of a right-angled triangle. The basics of trigonometry defines three primary functions which are sine, cosine and tangent.</p>

                                <p>Trigonometry is one of those divisions in mathematics that helps in finding the angles and missing sides of a triangle by the help of trigonometric ratios. The angles are either measured in radians or degrees. The usual trigonometry angles are 0°, 30°, 45°, 60° and 90°, which are commonly used.</p>
                                
                                <p>This branch divides into two sub-branches called plane trigonometry and spherical geometry. Here in this theory, you will learn about the trigonometric formulas, functions, and ratios, Right-Angled Triangles, etc.</p>

Sine, cosine, and tangent are 3 important trigonometric functions and are abbreviated as sin, cos, and tan. Let us see how are these ratios or functions, evaluated in the case of a right-angled triangle. <br>
                                Consider a right-angled triangle, where the longest side is called the hypotenuse, and the sides opposite to the hypotenuse is referred to as the adjacent and opposite. <p>

                                <p>The three basic functions in trigonometry are sine, cosine and tangent. Based on these three functions the other three functions that are cotangent, secant and cosecant are derived. <br>
                                
                                All the trigonometrical concepts are based on these functions. Hence to understand trigonometry further we need to learn first these functions and their respective formulas. </p>
                                
                                <p>If θ is the angle in a right-angled triangle, then <br>
                                
                                Sin θ = Perpendicular/Hypotenuse,
                                
                                Cos θ = Base/Hypotenuse,
                                
                                Tan θ = Perpendicular/Base,
                                
                                Perpendicular is the side opposite to the angle θ. <br>
                                
                                Base is the adjacent side to the angle θ. <br>
                                
                                Hypotenuse is the side opposite to right angle</p>
                                
                                <p>The other three functions i.e. cot, sec and cosec depend on tan, cos and sin respectively, such as: <br>
                                
                                Cot θ = 1/tan θ, 
                                
                                Sec θ = 1/cos θ,
                                
                                Cosec θ = 1/sin θ.
                                
                                Hence, 
                                
                                Cot θ = Base/Perpendicualr,

                                <p><strong><i style="color:#00ccff;">Trigonometry Examples</i></strong></p>
                                <p>There are many real life examples where trigonometry is used broadly. <br>
                                
                                If we have been given with height of the building and the angle formed when an object is seen from the top of the building, then the distance between object and bottom of the building can be determined by using the tangent function, such as tan of angle is equal to the ratio of the height of the building and the distance. Let us say the angle is ∝, then</p>
                                
                                <p>Tan ∝ = Height/Distance between object & building <br>
                                
                                Distance = Height/Tan ∝ <br>
                                
                                Let us assume that height is 20m and angle formed is 45 degrees, then <br>
                                
                                Distance = 20/Tan 45 <br>
                                 
                                Since, tan 45 = 1 <br>
                                
                                So, Distance = 20 m </p>
